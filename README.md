# Gulp template

This is my clean gulp template for creating frontend part for websites.

## Installation

This project uses yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## What can this template do?

1. Pug
2. SASS + PostCSS
3. ES6 + Automatic pollyfilling code where needed (depends on your browserlist in package.json and .babelrc)
4. Files minification
5. Image optimizations
6. Ready linting (Stylelint for SASS, Prettier, Editorconfig, Husky)

## Usage

**Development mode**. Gulp runs watcher that will automatically watch all your files.

```bash
yarn dev
```

**Production mode**

```bash
yarn build
```

### **I will add someday more info about how to use some specific functions, but not today...**

Feel free to use it. Hope you enjoy.
